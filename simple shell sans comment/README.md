# üêö C - Simple Shell Project

##### TOP


## üìò Project Description
This project is a custom implementation of a UNIX shell, developed as part of a low-level programming curriculum. The shell replicates basic behavior of `/bin/sh`, supporting command execution, environment management, and process control. It is designed to deepen understanding of system calls, process creation, and shell architecture.

## üéØ [Learning Objectives](#-learning-objectives)
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- Who designed the original UNIX operating system
- Who wrote the first UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (predecessor to C)
- Who Ken Thompson is
- How a shell works
- What a `pid` and `ppid` are
- How to manipulate the current process's environment
- The difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- The three prototypes of `main`
- How the shell uses `PATH` to locate programs
- How to execute another program using `execve`
- How to suspend a process until a child terminates
- What EOF (end-of-file) means

## üõ† [Requirements](#-requirements)
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to (why?)

## üöÄ [Features](#-features)

- **Interactive and non-interactive shell modes**
  The shell supports both real-time user input and piped/scripted command execution.

- **Command parsing and execution**
  User input is tokenized and interpreted to execute valid commands.

- **Environment variable access**
  The shell can read and use environment variables such as `PATH`.

- **Built-in commands**
  - `exit`: Terminates the shell session
  - `env`: Displays the current environment variables

- **Error handling with custom program name**
  Errors are displayed with the shell‚Äôs executable name (`argv[0]`) for clarity.

- **PATH resolution for external commands**
  Commands are located using the system‚Äôs `PATH` variable, allowing execution of programs without specifying full paths.

## ‚öôÔ∏è [Compilation](#Ô∏è-compilation)

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell
```

## üì• [Installation](#-installation)

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loicleguen/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git
cd your-repo-name
```
Replace `YourUsername/your-repo-name` with the actual path to this repository.

### 2. Execute the man page

We provide a script to execute the custom man page fo our Simple SHell.

Run the following command:

```bash
man ./man_1__simple_shell.1
```

[‚¨Ü](https://github.com/loicleguen/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/Loic/README.md#top)

## üöø [Memory Leak](#-memory-leak)

Check the memory leak with the following command:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full ./shell
```

Output:

```bash
==4192== LEAK SUMMARY:
==4192==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==4192==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==4192==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==4192==    still reachable: 1,144 bytes in 2 blocks
==4192==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==4192== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
==4192== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all
==4192==
==4192== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==4192== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```


## üîÅ [Recommended Development Process](#-recommended-development-process)

1. **Implement command parser**
   Tokenize user input to identify commands and arguments.

2. **Add execution logic using `fork` and `execve`**
   Create child processes to execute commands using system calls.

3. **Handle environment and PATH resolution**
   Use environment variables to locate executable files.

4. **Add built-in commands**
   Implement internal commands like `exit` and `env`.

5. **Test both interactive and non-interactive modes**
   Validate shell behavior with direct input and piped/scripted commands.

6. **Optimize and refactor**
   Improve code readability, modularity, and performance.

7. **Ensure Betty style compliance**
   Follow the Betty coding style for consistency and readability.
