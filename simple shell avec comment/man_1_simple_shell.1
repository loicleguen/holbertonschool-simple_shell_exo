.SH NAME
       _simple_shell - minimalist command-line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
       #include """shell.h""

       int _simple_shell(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _SIMPLE_SHELL

       is a simple command-line interpreter (shell) that executes
       commands either in interactive mode or by reading a command file.

       In interactive mode, simple_shell displays a prompt, waits for the user
       to enter a line, and then executes the specified command.  
       In non-interactive mode, simple_shell reads and executes commands from
       the file given as an argument.

       The shell searches for commands in the directories listed in the PATH
       environment variable, then executes them in a new process.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
       exit [n]
              Exit the shell with return code n (default is 0).

       env
              Display the current environment variables.

       cd [directory]
              Change the current working directory (default is $HOME).

.SH RETURN VALUE
       simple_shell returns 0 if all commands were executed successfully.
       A non-zero value indicates an error:

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
       Start the shell in interactive mode:
              $ ./simple_shell
              ($) ls -l
              ($) exit

       Execute commands from a script file:
              $ ./simple_shell script.sh
.fi
